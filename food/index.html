                <p>
                    Soto Kediri is a traditional soup from Kediri, East Java. What makes it special is the use of coconut milk, giving the broth a rich, yellow color. It's usually made with free-range chicken and spices like turmeric, ginger, lemongrass, garlic, and shallots. The soup is served with bean sprouts, potatoes, glass noodles, and boiled egg, then topped with fried shallots and celery.

                <p>
                    Gethuk Pisang is a unique banana-based snack from Kediri. Unlike the usual gethuk made from cassava, this version uses raja nangka bananas, known for their dense texture. The bananas are steamed, mashed, and mixed with natural flavorings to form a soft, sweet treat. This snack has roots in Kediri's royal history and is believed to be a favorite of Princess Sekartaji. Gethuk Pisang is perfect to be bought as a souvenir.

                <p>
                    Pecel Tumpang is Kediri's version of the classic Javanese salad. Instead of peanut sauce, it uses a unique spicy sauce made from fermented tempeh called sambal tumpang. The sauce is cooked with chilies, bay leaves, galangal, shallots, coconut milk, and seasonings. It's poured over boiled vegetables like long beans, spinach, chayote flowers, and bean sprouts. The dish is often served with rice and side dishes like fried egg, crispy crackers, or chicken offal satay. It's a flavorful and hearty local favorite.
