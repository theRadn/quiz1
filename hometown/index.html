                <h2>Kediri Regency</h2>
                <p>
                    The Regency itself covers an area of 1,563.42 km<sup>2</sup> and had a population of 1,635,294 at the 2020 census.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The capital of the regency is in the town of Ngasem, which is effectively a northern suburb of Kediri city, just about 200 metres over the municipal border. However, several regency government establishments are also located within Kediri city, although it is administratively a separate political entity. This is because both the regency and the city share common cultural and historical roots, and the administrative division occurred only after the War of Independence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The regency shares borders with Jombang Regency to the north, Malang Regency to the east, Blitar Regency and Tulungagung Regency to the south, and Nganjuk Regency to the west, while Kediri city is wholly surrounded within the Regency. Kelud mountain, one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia, is partially administered by the Government of Kediri Regency (along with Blitar Regency).
